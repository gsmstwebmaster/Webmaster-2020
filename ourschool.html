    <h4 class="media-heading"><b>PhysEng</b></h4>
    <p>All freshmen students at GSMST are required to complete the following courses: Gifted Physics, Engineering Concepts,and Foundation of Engineering/Technology. These courses are all taken together in a block period (two consecutive periods). Students are given first-hand experience with the engineering design process and hands-on construction alongside state-of-the-art workshops for each classroom. Students also learn how to use professional CAD software such as Autodesk Inventor and AutoCAD.</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Engineering Applications</b></h4>
    <p>Engineering Applications is a continuation of the engineering pathway (started in freshman year) to sophomore year. Students learn engineering principles such as Truss Analysis, Mechanics of Materials and CO2 Car Calculations which later help with the projects done in the class itself. Students design, construct and test their own CO2 car, Truss Bridge and Model Rocket. In addition, students apply engineering management concepts to help aid their building process.</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Science & Engineering Fair</b></h4>
    <p>All sophomore students at GSMST are required to complete a full project for the Intel Science and Engineering Fair as part of the advanced STEM curriculum. In the traditional Science Fair, students examine a particular topic, perform experiments and draw conclusions based on their data. Similarly, students in the Engineering Fair utilize the engineering design process through identifying a problem and designing a solution or device.</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Junior Fellowship Experience/Senior Capstone Experience</b></h4>
    <p>All junior and senior students at GSMST are required to participate in an internship, or fellowship, experience during both their junior and senior years. These fellowship experiences allow students to connect with a mentor who is a current practitioner in applied science, technology, mathematics, and/or engineering fields. The Junior Fellowships include on-site collaboration with the mentor at his/her office and/or lab, as well as virtual or remote contact.</p>

    <b> Digital Media Club</b>
    <br>Students in this club work on their video production skills using software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. In addition, students help produce the school’s morning announcements, videos of our school’s mandatory summer program (Summer STEM) for incoming freshmen, and International Night videos.
