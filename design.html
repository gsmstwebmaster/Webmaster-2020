        Our company was founded in 2012. Our founders started the company off interestingly on a tour throughout Europe. While in Norway, they were inspired by the eco-friendly city of Oslo and noted the abundant use of electric cars. The founders realized that America would greatly benefit from a wide-use of electric cars to take a step closer to a cleaner world. Ever since then, our founders have dedicated their lives to perfecting environmentally friendly cars produced in the United States at an affordable price.

        <h1>Benefits of ENZO™ Cars</h1>
        <p>
          Our car models are <b>BEVS (Battery Electric Vehicles)</b> and <b>fully electric</b>. They produce zero carbon emissions and are much cheaper than conventional vehicles. In addition, electric motors systems are approximately four times efficient than regular internal combustion engines. More specifically, our cars use hydrogen fuel cells to convert hydrogen gas and oxygen into electricity. Not much maintenance is required since our cars also work on regenerative braking which reduces the wear of the system itself.

        <h1>ENZO™ Model M</h1>
        <p style="border-style:solid";"border-width: 5px";"margin: 30px">
          Both of our cars include solar-paneled sunroofs which enable the car to charge while driving. Solar paneled roofs increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 carbon emissions. More specifically, it can charge up to 6 hours and harness solar energy through silicon cells. This allows the car to charge while driving, essentially efficiently multitasking.
          <br><br>
          To enhance our user-friendliness, we designed falcon-wing doors to help the customer. The doors can either be automatic or lifted up and down manually. For additional safety, there are motion sensors located on the outside and inside of the doors to detect and stop moving when objects are close by.

        <p style="border-style:solid";"border-width: 5px";"margin: 30px">
          In addition to the regular batteries, this car also has <b>back-up batteries</b>. These batteries are always charged and can be manually or automatically enabled (depending on driver’s preference). It is only used in emergency situations and allows for long road trips since it is a safety precaution.
        <br><br>
          This car’s outer composition includes portions of <b>carbon negative material</b>. Carbon negative material is essentially biomass that can intake more carbon dioxide gas than given off. It is a black and fire-resistant (reduces flammability) material that can be compressed into tiles or other products. Thus, we integrated the material into the outer skin of this car, further reducing car emissions.
